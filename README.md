# Weekly_Task_Scheduler.c
This C program implements a priority-based weekly task scheduler using priority queues (min-heap) data structure. It allows users to input tasks with priorities and descriptions, then distributes them evenly across the seven days of the week while maintaining priority order.

## Features ✨
- Priority-based task scheduling (1 = highest priority)
- Even distribution of tasks across 7 days
- Dynamic memory management
- Simple command-line interface
- Error handling for edge cases

## Installation ⚙️
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shansita-S/weekly-task-scheduler.git

2. Compile the program:
   gcc scheduler.c -o scheduler

Usage 🖥️
Run the program and enter tasks:
./scheduler

Input format:
[priority] [task description]

Example input:
1 Complete project submission
3 Buy groceries
2 Schedule team meeting
-1  # Ends input

How It Works 🔧
Tasks are stored in a min-heap priority queue

The scheduler:
Processes highest priority tasks first
Distributes tasks round-robin across days
Ensures priority-1 tasks always go to Monday
Output shows the organized weekly schedule

Example 📋
Input:
1 Finalize presentation
3 Gym workout
2 Email client
-1

Output:
Monday:
Priority: 1, Description: Finalize presentation

Tuesday:
Priority: 2, Description: Email client

Wednesday:
Priority: 3, Description: Gym workout
